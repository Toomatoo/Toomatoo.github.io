<p>Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing and running computing
applications on a cluster of com- puters or hosts. Nowadays, many tasks of
companies and research associations are accomplished through taking use of
Hadoop. For the sake of efficiency and economy, people request a Hadoop cluster
system with better performance. The performance of Hadoop relies on many factors.
The basic factor is the algorithm of Hadoop, like how the mapper and reducer
work and how the Hadoop controller distributes tasks to mappers/reducers.
Since Hadoop is deployed on a cluster of computers, the network for the cluster
obviously affects the transmission of data and control information. In intuition,
even though the mappers and reducers can work very fast, the network with high
latency and drop rate which cause a long transmission time will lead to bad
performance in a Hadoop system.</p>

<p>Our concern is focused on the network of Hadoop system. According to some basic
experiment, the time of maps and reduces only occupies about 30% of the
completion time for one Hadoop job. It means network transmission takes lots of
time in a Hadoop job. The fact gives us an opportunity to improve the
performance of Hadoop system.</p>

<p>Network for Hadoop system is much different from the network we use for daily
life. The features of Hadoop systems and applications make the network maintain
some properties. We talk about the features of Hadoop and the network in the
Section V . If we can catch and take use of the properties and information,
there will be a more efficient network for Hadoop jobs whose completion time
mainly comes from maps and reduces. This is why we consider about using SDN for
the Hadoop cluster. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to allow a
network controller to manage the network scheduling in order to take fully use
of the resources and improve the performance of the softwares running on the
network. SDN decouples the decisions where the traffic is sent (control plane)
from how to forward the traffic to the destination (data plane). As to Hadoop
applications, SDN aims at a better traffic scheduling by considering how the
mappers and reducers work and how the tasks are distributed.</p>

<p>Our idea of traffic optimization for Hadoop based on SDN derives from FlowComb
and Pythia. They build an SDN control module for the Hadoop cluster system which
collect the information from running mappers and reducers and then adjust flow
scheduling for the routers and switches in the network. Our system architechture
is designed according to the same idea, but we made some modification and
adjustment for some algorithm details and implementation of the system. It is
mostly concerned about SDN for Hadoop that what kinds of information should be
collected and how the network and flows are scheduled. On the whole, we collect
information like the start/end time of hadoop map/recude tasks on each node and
the activities of HDFS. Then the SDN controller analyses the information and
updates a Load Graph held in the controller and deploy new flow scheduling rules
to the switches and routers regularly. The Load Graph reflects the load level
for the facilities in the network. Our goal is to schedule flows avoiding the
nodes with large load.</p>
