<p>Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing and running computing
applications on a cluster of com- puters or hosts. Nowadays, many tasks of
companies and research associations are accomplished through taking use of
Hadoop. For the sake of efficiency and economy, people request a Hadoop cluster
system with better performance. The performance of Hadoop relies on many factors.
The basic factor is the algorithm of Hadoop, like how the mapper and reducer
work and how the Hadoop controller distributes tasks to mappers/reducers.
Since Hadoop is deployed on a cluster of computers, the network for the cluster
obviously affects the transmission of data and control information. In intuition,
even though the mappers and reducers can work very fast, the network with high
latency and drop rate which cause a long transmission time will lead to bad
performance in a Hadoop system.</p>

<p>Our concern is focused on the network of Hadoop system. According to some basic
experiment, the time of maps and reduces only occupies about 30% of the
completion time for one Hadoop job. It means network transmission takes lots of
time in a Hadoop job. The fact gives us an opportunity to improve the
performance of Hadoop system.</p>

<p>Network for Hadoop system is much different from the network we use for daily
life. The features of Hadoop systems and applications make the network maintain
some properties. We talk about the features of Hadoop and the network in the
Section V . If we can catch and take use of the properties and information,
there will be a more efficient network for Hadoop jobs whose completion time
mainly comes from maps and reduces. This is why we consider about using SDN for
the Hadoop cluster. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to allow a
network controller to manage the network scheduling in order to take fully use
of the resources and improve the performance of the softwares running on the
network. SDN decouples the decisions where the traffic is sent (control plane)
from how to forward the traffic to the destination (data plane). As to Hadoop
applications, SDN aims at a better traffic scheduling by considering how the
mappers and reducers work and how the tasks are distributed.</p>

<p>Our idea of traffic optimization for Hadoop based on SDN derives from FlowComb
and Pythia. They build an SDN control module for the Hadoop cluster system which
collect the information from running mappers and reducers and then adjust flow
scheduling for the routers and switches in the network. Our system architechture
is designed according to the same idea, but we made some modification and
adjustment for some algorithm details and implementation of the system. It is
mostly concerned about SDN for Hadoop that what kinds of information should be
collected and how the network and flows are scheduled. On the whole, we collect
information like the start/end time of hadoop map/recude tasks on each node and
the activities of HDFS. Then the SDN controller analyses the information and
updates a Load Graph held in the controller and deploy new flow scheduling rules
to the switches and routers regularly. The Load Graph reflects the load level
for the facilities in the network. Our goal is to schedule flows avoiding the
nodes with large load.</p>

<h2 id="architechture-of-hadoop-on-sdn">Architechture of Hadoop on SDN</h2>

<p>At a high level of abstraction, our system included three components shown figure
below:</p>

<p><img src="https://toomatoo.github.io/img/posts/sdnarch.jpg" alt="image" />{ width: 300px; }</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hadoop cluster with SDN. This part is mainly deployment of Hadoop
master/slave nodes. For the sake of SDN, we replace normal routers and switches
with open source switches.</li>
  <li>Instrument Process (we call it Auxiliary Process) runs on each node who
collects information of the Hadoop node and sends it to the SDN control system.</li>
  <li>SDN control system. This module is the core of our system architecture. It
consists of two parts: routing computation and flow allocation. After
collecting the information from auxiliary processes, the control module executes
routing computation to check if the topology of the network changes, then the
flow allocation part will update flow allocation rules according to the
LoadGraph which is gotten from the analysis of information collected.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-setup-experiments">How to Setup Experiments</h2>

<p>The experimental setup can be concluded into three phases:
1. Setting up virtual Hadoop clusters: Since we have no access to physical
computing cluster, we utilize virtual nodes for setting up Hadoop clusters.
<strong>Vagrant</strong> is a powerful tools used to eliminate repeat work by setting up,
booting and provision all virtual nodes with Vagrantfile
(/vagrant/Vagrantfile). We allocate 8GB memory to the namenode and 1GB to
datanodes. Besides, We select ubuntu server 14.04 as the system for these nodes
and only install the GUI on the name node for furthur Hadoop jobs tracking.
2. Setting up SDN network: For this phase, we use <strong>GNS32</strong> to combine our virtual
Hadoop clusters and <strong>Miniet</strong>. Briefly, GNS3 is a network simulator that can
provide a totally isolated network environment, Figure 4 shows one of our
examples in GNS3 for Hadoop cluster testing. Mininet is also a great way to
develop, share, and experiment with OpenFlow and Software Defined Networking
systems. Through GNS3, we bind our virtual nodes as hosts in Miniet and we
choose <strong>Fat-tree</strong> as the network topology.
3. Parallelized Development: We also notice that the underlying parallelization
of our development. That is, we isolate SDN algorithm development from Hadoop
cluster installation and testing. Specifically, we feed the Mininet with Hadoop
job track logs available online and simulate the shuffle stage in Mininet host
as precise as possible. By doing this, we can start developing SDN controller
at the beginning of our project and don’t have to wait for Hadoop clusters to be
set up.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We first point out the problem that shuffling take a large percentage of total
running time of a Hadoop job, which due to insufficient usage of the network.
Then, we implement a system based on Software-Define Network (SDN) to optimize
network traffic for Hadoop shuffle stage. The idea is to build an SDN control
module to adjust flow scheduling and achieve a more balanced flow allocation.
The SDN controller collects the information from running mappers and reducers
using an Auxiliary Process, and then updates a Load Graph which reflects the
workload in the network. The flow scheduling strategy working with k-shortest
paths routing algorithm dis- tributes different flows on the paths to the
destination. We simulate the whole system with <strong>Cloudera</strong>, <strong>Mininet</strong>, <strong>GNS3</strong>,
<strong>OpenvSwitch</strong> and other softwares. By utilizing this system, we create a set of
Hadoop jobs and observe the task completion time. Compared to the normal network,
our system based on SDN improves the overal performance of Hadoop cluster system
on big data and large clusters.</p>
