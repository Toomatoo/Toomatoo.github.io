At this stage, with some graduate classes, I am supposed to learn some new
technologies in systems, data mining and etc. How to learn a new technology is
one of my concerns during learning.

For example, I've used `map` `reduce` before, but `Spark`. This quarter, in the
big data course, I am supposed to implement algorithms in `PySpark`. I can
quickly dive into coding with it, because I am familiar with `Python` and
the logistics of MapReduce. However, I think I need more practice because
algorithm design with MapReduce is much different with normal algorithm design.
Under the situation like this, I found that even thought I am not very much
familiar with `Spark`, I can mostly learn by doing. On the other hand, sometimes,
I am not very confident because I've not gone through details of `Spark` or
`PySpark` which may make me miss something when coding. The action for this, I
think, is to go through more details after a set of coding practice.

For other circumstance, it is not a same way to learn a new technology. For
instance, I am completely a newbie of `Docker`. I'd better go through the
official tutorial of it and learn about the idea, framework and code of it.
Then I get the ability to build a system from scratch. After some experiment,
it is very critical to look through tutorials or brief books when the thing is
almost complete new for me, such as `Haskell` and `Docker`. And note: find
**official** tutorials and **authoritative** brief books, which can give me a
_shortcut_ for learning.

Therefore, there are two kinds of new technologies, familiar and not familiar.
The ways for learning them is described above. Besides that, there are still
some tips for myself. First, for the familiar things, do not stay in the comfort
zone, try to learn and implement some general and useful things that is very
important and not appear in the homework or something. For example, I am
proficient in `Java`, but I clearly know that I do not know every thing of it,
or I am not that familiar with some parts. Nowadays, I am trying to implement
some general tools in `Java`, such as network clients/servers. Maybe later GUI
in `Java` and etc. For another example, I've start to add code into a repo on
`GitHub`. The repo contains many python data tools which is implemented for the
sake of reuse.

The ways may be wrong or not efficient. Still trying...
